# This file can be left empty or used for package-level initialization if needed.
"""
scripts package initializer.

This file marks the `scripts/` directory as a Python package
so that modules inside (e.g., nb01_helper.py) can be imported
using standard package syntax:

    from scripts import nb01_helper
    from scripts.nb01_helper import search, load_store

Notes:
- Without this file, Python may not recognize `scripts/` as a package
  in some environments.
- The file can remain empty if no package-level logic is needed.
- We keep it for clarity and to make imports consistent across
  different notebooks (nb01, nb02-demo, nb03-eval, etc.).
